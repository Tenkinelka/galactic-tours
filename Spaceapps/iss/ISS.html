        The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-nation construction
        project that is the largest single structure humans ever put into space.
        It is the largest humanmade object ever to orbit Earth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The first piece of the International Space Station was launched in
        November 1998. Its main construction was completed between 1998 and
        2011.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        ISS has a pressurized volume of approximately 900 m<sup>3</sup> (31,000 ft3) and a
        mass over 400,000 kg.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The ISS solar arrays cover an area of 2,247 m<sup>2</sup> and can
        generate 735,000 kW-hours of electrical power per year.</li> <br />
        <li> ISS orbits at an altitude of between 370–460 km. Its
          falls towards Earth continually due to atmospheric friction and requires
          periodic rocket firings to boost the orbit. The ISS orbital inclination
          is 51.6°, permitting ISS to fly over 90% of the inhabited Earth. </li>
          <br>
          <li>
          you can get a magnificent view of earth from the ISS and also watch the nothern lights from up there.</li>
