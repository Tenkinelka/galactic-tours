        <h1>Mars: The Red Planet</h1>
        <p><strong>Also known as:</strong> Red Planet</p>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Mars has a wide range of temperatures due to its thin atmosphere and distance from the sun. The average temperature is around -80 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures on Mars can vary significantly depending on the location and time of day.</p>
        <p><strong>Time taken to travel:</strong> It takes about 5 to 10 months to reach Mars.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenery:</strong> The surface of Mars is dominated by reddish hues which give the planet a reddish appearance. Mars has some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in Mars and the solar system, which is over 21km high. Mars used to have flowing water, leading to lakes, oceans, or relatively gentle streams.</p>

        <p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Mars’ atmosphere is mostly composed of CO2 with trace amounts of Nitrogen and Argon. It contains only trace amounts of Oxygen, making it impossible for humans to breathe without supplemental oxygen.</p>
        <p><strong>Moons:</strong> Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phobos:</strong> It is the larger and closer of the two moons. It has a mean radius of about 11.1km and a heavily cratered and irregularly shaped surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Deimos:</strong> Smaller compared to Phobos with a mean radius of about 6.2km.</li>

            </ul>

        </p>
        <p><strong>Pressure:</strong> The average surface pressure on Mars is about 6.36 millibars, which is approximately 0.6% of Earth’s atmospheric pressure at sea level. This low atmospheric level would result in the rapid decompression of bodily fluids, leading to serious health problems.</p>
